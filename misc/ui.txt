Building Beautiful UIs with Flutter
===================================
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter/

Build the main user interface:
- The "runApp()" function takes as its argument a Widget which the Flutter framework expands and displays to the screen of the app at run time. Create a new MaterialApp object and pass it to the "runApp()" function; this widget becomes the root of your widget tree.
- To lay the groundwork for interactive components, break the simple app into two different subclasses of widget: a root-level "Netchat" widget that never changes and a child "ChatScreen" widget that can rebuild when messages are sent and internal state changes.

Add a UI for composing messages:
- Flutter provides a Material Design widget called "TextField". It's a stateful widget (mutable state) with properties for customizing the behavior of the input field. State is information that can be read synchronously when the widget is built and that might change during the lifetime of the widget.
- If you want to >>> visually present stateful data in a widget <<<, you should encapsulate this data in a "State" object. You can then associate your State object with a widget that extends the StatefulWidget class.
- To manage interactions with the text field, it's helpful to use a "TextEditingController" object. You'll use it for reading the contents of the input field, and for clearing the field after the text message is sent.
- Start with a "Container" widget that adds a horizontal margin between the edge of the screen and each side of the input field. The units here are logical pixels that get translated into a specific number of physical pixels, depending on a device's pixel ratio.
- Add a "TextField" widget and configure it as follows to manage user interactions:
    1. To have control over the contents of the text field, we'll provide the "TextField" constructor with a "TextEditingController". This controller can also be used to clear the field or read its value.
    2. To be notified when the user submits a message, use the onSubmitted argument to provide a private callback method "_handleSubmitted()". For now, this method will just clear the field, and later on we'll add more to code to send the message.
- Add a responsive "Send" button. Since we want to display the button adjacent to the input field, we'll use a "Row" widget as the parent. Then wrap the "TextField" widget in a "Flexible" widget. This tells the "Row" to automatically size the text field to use the remaining space that isn't used by the button.
- The color of the button is black from the default Material Design theme. Icons inherit their color, opacity and size from an "IconTheme" widget, which uses an "IconThemeData" object to define these characteristics. Wrap all the widgets in the "_buildTextComposer()" method in an "IconTheme" widget and use its data property to specify the "ThemeData" object of the current theme. This gives all icons in this part of the widget tree the accent color of the current theme. A BuildContext object is a handle to the location of a widget in your app's widget tree.

Add a UI for displaying messages:
- We need a widget that represents a single chat message. Define a "StatelessWidget" called "ChatMessage" as follows. Its "build()" method returns a "Row" widget that displays a simple graphical avatar to represent the user who sent the message, a "Column" widget containing the sender's name, and the text of the message.
- The next refinement is to get the list of chat messages and show it in the UI. We want this list to be scrollable so that users can view the chat history. The list should also present the messages in chronological order with the most recent message displayed at the bottom-most row of the visible list.
- You call "setState()" to modify "_messages" and to let the framework know this part of the widget tree has changed and it needs to rebuild the UI. Only synchronous operations should be performed in "setState()", because otherwise the framework could rebuild the widgets before the operation finishes.
- You're now ready to display the list of chat messages. We'll get the ChatMessage widgets from the _messages list and put them in a ListView widget, for a scrollable list. We choose the ListView.builder constructor because the default constructor doesn't automatically detect mutations of its children argument.
- "Flexible", as a parent of "ListView". This tells the framework to let the list of received messages expand to fill the "Column" height while "TextField" remains a fixed size.
- The standard "ListView" constructor works well for small lists. To work with lists that contain a large number of items, itâ€™s best to use the "ListView.builder" constructor. In contrast to the default "ListView" constructor, which requires creating all items at once, the "ListView.builder()" constructor creates items as they are scrolled onto the screen.

Animate your app:
- Animations in Flutter are encapsulated as "Animation" objects that contain a typed value and a status such as forward, backward, completed, and dismissed. You can attach an animation object to a widget or listen for changes to the animation object. Based on changes to the animation object's properties, the framework can modify the way your widget appears and rebuild the widget tree.
- Use the "AnimationController" class to specify how the animation should run. The "AnimationController" class lets you define important characteristics of the animation, such as its (1) playback direction and (2) duration.
- When creating an "AnimationController", you must pass it a "vsync" argument. The vsync prevents animations that are offscreen from consuming unnecessary resources. To use your "ChatScreenState" as the vsync, include a "TickerProviderStateMixin" mixin in the ChatScreenState class definition.
- Modify the "_handleSubmitted()" method in your "ChatScreenState" class as follows. In this method, instantiate an "AnimationController" object and specify the animation's runtime duration to be 700 milliseconds. Attach the animation controller to a new "ChatMessage" instance, and specify that the animation should play forward whenever a new message is added to the chat list.
- Modify the "ChatMessage" object's build() method to return a "SizeTransition" widget that wraps the Container child widget we previously defined. The "SizeTransition" class provides an animation effect where the width or height of its child is multiplied by a given size factor value. The "CurvedAnimation" object in conjunction with the "SizeTransition" class produces an ease-out animation effect. The ease-out effect causes the message to slide in quickly at the beginning of the animation and slow down until it comes to a stop.
- It's good practice to dispose of your animation controllers to free up your resources when they are no longer needed. In the current app, the framework does not call the dispose() method since the app only has a single screen. In a more complex app with multiple screens, the framework would invoke the method when the ChatScreenState object was no longer in use.

Wrap longer lines:
- When a user sends a text that exceeds the width of the UI for displaying messages, the lines should wrap so the entire message displays. Right now, lines that overflow are truncated and a error message is displayed. A simple way of making sure the text wraps correctly is to add an "Expanded" widget.
- You will wrap the "Column" widget where messages are displayed in an "Expanded" widget. "Expanded" allows a widget like "Column" to impose layout constraints on a child widget. Here it constrains the width of the "Text" widget which is normally determined by its contents.

Future/Stream:

- FutureBuilder is a widget that returns another widget based on the Futureâ€™s execution result.
- The next thing to do is to be able to get the values from a stream. This is commonly referred to as subscribing or listening to a stream. When you subscribe to a stream you will only get the values that are put onto the stream after the subscription. You subscribe to the stream by calling the listen() function and supplying it with a Function to call back to when there's a new value available.
